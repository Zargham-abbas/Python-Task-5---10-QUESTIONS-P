# Question_8:
# Create a complex number variable, comp_num, with real and imaginary parts. Print both parts separately. Understand the representation of complex numbers in Python.

# Create a complex number with real and imaginary parts
complex_num = 5 + 6j;

# Access the real and imaginary parts
real_part = complex_num.real;
imaginary_part = complex_num.imag;

# Print both parts separately
print("Real part:",real_part);
print("Imaginary part:",imaginary_part);

# RUN!
# DONE!
